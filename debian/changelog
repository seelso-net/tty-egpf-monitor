tty-egpf-monitor (0.7.10-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * CRITICAL FIX: Correct version labeling - APT package was mislabeled as 0.7.9-1 but contained v0.4.73
  * MAJOR FIX: TTY event detection from external processes now works correctly
  * FIXED: eBPF programs now emit OPEN events via raw syscall tracepoints
  * FIXED: Ring buffer interruptions eliminated by disabling fd_scanner
  * FIXED: Event filtering logic allows external process events
  * WORKING: Port state transitions (ACTIVE â†” PASSIVE)
  * WORKING: Event logging to files with timestamps
  * WORKING: Reliable operation on Ubuntu 24.04
  * This version resolves the core issue where the daemon only detected its own events
  * Now properly monitors TTY usage from minicom, picocom, stty, and all other applications
