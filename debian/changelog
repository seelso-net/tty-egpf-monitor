tty-egpf-monitor (0.7.14-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * CRITICAL FIX: Move changelog update before build in release workflow
  * CRITICAL FIX: The changelog was being updated AFTER building the binary
  * CRITICAL FIX: This caused version mismatch: package showed new version but binary had old version
  * CRITICAL FIX: Now changelog is updated BEFORE building, ensuring binary and package versions match
  * CRITICAL FIX: Fixes issue where APT package 0.7.13 contained binary with version 0.7.11

tty-egpf-monitor (0.7.13-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * DEBUG: Add comprehensive event logging to diagnose filtering issues
  * DEBUG: Print all events received by handle_event function
  * DEBUG: Show which events are being filtered out and why
  * DEBUG: This will help identify if events are not being generated or filtered incorrectly

tty-egpf-monitor (0.7.12-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * DEBUG: Add version and build info printing to daemon startup
  * DEBUG: Print daemon version, build date/time, binary path, and PID on startup
  * DEBUG: This will help verify which binary is actually running
  * DEBUG: Useful for debugging APT vs local build issues

tty-egpf-monitor (0.7.10-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * CRITICAL FIX: Correct version labeling - APT package was mislabeled as 0.7.9-1 but contained v0.4.73
  * MAJOR FIX: TTY event detection from external processes now works correctly
  * FIXED: eBPF programs now emit OPEN events via raw syscall tracepoints
  * FIXED: Ring buffer interruptions eliminated by disabling fd_scanner
  * FIXED: Event filtering logic allows external process events
  * WORKING: Port state transitions (ACTIVE â†” PASSIVE)
  * WORKING: Event logging to files with timestamps
  * WORKING: Reliable operation on Ubuntu 24.04
  * This version resolves the core issue where the daemon only detected its own events
  * Now properly monitors TTY usage from minicom, picocom, stty, and all other applications
