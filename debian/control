Description: Advanced Serial Port Monitoring with eBPF Technology
 A sophisticated real-time serial port monitoring tool that combines
 the power of eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) with intelligent
 state management to provide comprehensive visibility into TTY device
 activity. Perfect for debugging, reverse engineering, and monitoring
 serial communications.
 .
 Features:
  * Dual-mode operation (active/passive monitoring)
  * Real-time data capture and analysis
  * eBPF-based packet filtering
  * Comprehensive logging and reporting
  * Support for various serial protocols
